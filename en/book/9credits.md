This module was originally developed by Kris from France, and is using [Holmes.css created by Luke Williams](http://www.red-root.com/sandbox/holmes/index.html), 
which was inspired by [InuitCss](http://csswizardry.com/inuitcss/), [Eric Meyer](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/diagnostics/), [NealGrossKopf](http://www.nealgrosskopf.com/tech/thread.php?pid=17)!
